# LoginProject

This was the final project for CS-332 Advanced Computing. I had already finished the class work early, so I decided tochallenge myself and do something I've never done before. For some reason the thought of doing the project as a mobile app just stuck with me. My plan was to have a login system substitute the searching algorithm. Once you logged in, you would able to see all the salary information. I had to continually learn new things and adapt when doing this project. If I had to do this project over again, I would make a more concrete plan that I could divide into small parts instead of trying to figure things out everytime I hit an obstacle.

The mobile app works by talking to a REST API that I made using Nodejs, ExpressJs and MySql as the database.
